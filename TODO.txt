- Add tooltip describing IoT
    An IoT (Internet of Things) system is a network of interconnected devices that collect, exchange, 
    and act on data through the internet or other communication networks. These devices, often equipped 
    with sensors, actuators, and software, can range from everyday objects like smart thermostats and 
    wearable fitness trackers to complex industrial machinery. The goal of an IoT system is to enable 
    automation, improve efficiency, and provide valuable insights by integrating and analyzing data from 
    these devices.
